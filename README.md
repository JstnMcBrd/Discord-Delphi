# Discord-Delphi

Discord-Delphi is a [Discord](https://discord.com/) bot developed in JavaScript that uses the [Delphi AI](https://delphi.allenai.org/) to provide moral and ethical judgements. Through the bot, users can have their messages judged for morality. The bot also hosts other features that help integrate it with the Discord chat environment.
 
This project was started and finished in October 2021 using the codebase of the [Discord-Cleverbot](https://github.com/JstnMcBrd/Discord-Cleverbot) project.
